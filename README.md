## Description

A simple counter application built in Redux from Frontend Masters'  course: State Management with Redux and Mobx (https://frontendmasters.com/courses/redux-mobx/). Learned how to create a redux store and reducer, how to use dipatch to update the state passing in an action and how to connect Redux to React using the Provider component. 

The course also demonstrates how to use the Connect API- extracting data with mapStateToProps and dispatching actions with mapDispatchToProps. In this application, we're returning the current state and pointing to store.dispatch to increment and decrement the number. 


## Frameworks and Libraries: 

* React
* Redux
